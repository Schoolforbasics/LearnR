Test the Open Movie Database API


```{r}
library(devtools)
devtools::install_github("hrbrmstr/omdbapi")
library(omdbapi)
library(dplyr)
library(pbapply)
 
search_by_title("Captain America")
 ```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
